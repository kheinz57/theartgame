#Th.ArtGame -- TheArtGame

##Combining Art with learning Rust and bevy the rust game engine

Th because this is the artists signature on the paintings. Which stands for Therese P., my mother in law, which passed away 2023. She was really a very skilled painter without any audiance, except her family and some friends. While searching a project for learning Rust I came across bevy. While I was never into games, I got some interest into bevys ECS. And since I wanted to show her paintings this is simply an interesting combination.

The current version is far away from some dreamy I have, so it lets enough room for me to learn. But also for you if you would like. These are things I can imagine to do.
Having a version running in the browser would be especially cool.


ToDo list:
- adjust the pictures to there real size according to a list (Done)
- add more paintings. There are about 30 paintings available. But not all are scanned yet
- create room for paintings. Possibly still without ceiling to be able to fly
- create frames around the pictures
- add a spot light to each painting
- add some additional detailed pictured when zoom it a lot or upon any other action. I have zoom ins as well as side and back views.
- add some explanation of the paintings. At least on some of them I have some more details. On one even an audio recording. 
- automatically fly a short or long tour thrue the museum
- build a real museum with walls and so on as option. Although hanging the paintings onto the air seems like a funny thing as well.
- add other rooms for other artists as well.
- add other visitors which are possibly even walk or fly around as well autonomously
- make it availabe as webassembly based web page - best via github.io would be great
